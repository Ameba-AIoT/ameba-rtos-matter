### Matter Application

The following `make` commands correspond to different device types applicable in Realtek's SDK

#### AmebaDplus (RTL8721Dx) Commands:

```bash
make -C asdk all_clusters / air_purifier / aircon_port / bridge_dm / bridge_port / dishwasher_port / fan_port
             laundrywasher_port / light_dm / light_port / microwaveoven_port / refrigerator_port / thermostat_port
```

#### AmebaLite (RTL8720EA / RTL8726EA) Commands:

```bash
make -C asdk all_clusters / air_purifier / aircon_port / bridge_dm / bridge_port / dishwasher_port / fan_port
             laundrywasher_port / light_dm / light_port / microwaveoven_port / refrigerator_port / thermostat_port
```

#### AmebaSmart (RTL8730E) Commands:

```bash
make -C asdk all_clusters / air_purifier / aircon_port / bridge_dm / bridge_port / dishwasher_port / fan_port
             laundrywasher_port / light_dm / light_port / microwaveoven_port / refrigerator_port / thermostat_port
```

### Matter Application Types

There are two different types of Matter applications:

#### Connectedhomeip Repository Applications:
- Sourced from the connectedhomeip repository.
- Includes: `all_clusters`, `air_purifier`, `light`

#### Realtek's Porting Layer Applications:
- Utilizes Realtek's Porting Layer for specific device integrations.
- Includes: `aircon_port`, `bridge_dm`, `dishwasher_port`, `laundrywasher_port`, `light_port`, `light_dm`, `microwaveoven_port`, `refrigerator_port`, `thermostat_port`.
