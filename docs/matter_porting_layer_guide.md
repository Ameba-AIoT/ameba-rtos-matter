# Matter Application with Realtek Porting Layer

The porting layer facilitates the development of custom Matter applications by providing core Matter APIs and supporting the integration of peripheral drivers.

### Directory Structure

| Directory | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| common    | Contains common files and utilities essential for all Matter applications. |
| core      | Provides core Matter APIs for seamless integration into various hardware platforms. |
| driver    | Houses peripheral drivers utilized by Matter application callbacks. |
| example   | Includes Matter application examples categorized by device types for reference and customization. |

### Designing Custom Matter Applications with the Porting Layer

To create your own custom Matter application using the porting layer:

1. **Common and Core Modules**: No modifications are required in the `common` or `core` directories as they provide foundational APIs and utilities.

2. **Peripheral Drivers**: Add your peripheral driver code in the `driver` directory. Refer to existing driver files for guidance.

3. **Creating or Modifying Examples**:
   - Use the `example` directory to create a new custom example or modify an existing one.
   - Your custom example should include at least the following files:
     - Main task implementation (e.g., `light/example_matter_light.cpp`).
     - Driver interface implementation (e.g., `light/matter_drivers.cpp`).
     - Makefiles necessary to build the Matter libraries.

4. **Readme and Documentation**: Refer to the examples' readme files for detailed instructions on integrating and customizing your Matter application.

This structure and approach simplify the process of building and extending Matter-compliant applications on Ameba, ensuring flexibility and ease of integration with peripheral hardware.
