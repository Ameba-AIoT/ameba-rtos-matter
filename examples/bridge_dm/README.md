# Bridge-app using Ameba Data Model Example
This example is an implementation of the *Bridge* device type. The Bridge will be communicating with the other non-Matter peripherals via TCP sockets.
You will need 2 non-Matter peripherals running TCP client socket.

## ZAP
We will use `bridge-app.zap` instead of the zap file within the connectedhomeip example.

## Ameba Data Model
This example demonstrates adding and removing endpoints dynamically using the *Ameba Data Model*.
A `Root Node` device type will be created on Endpoint0, a `Aggregator` device type on Endpoint1 and a `Dimmable Light` device type on Endpoint2.
After 20 seconds delay, the `Dimmable Light` endpoint on Endpoint2 will be removed.

Additionally a new thread will be created for user to input their code to communicate with non-matter device based on the protocol (e.g., IP-based (TCP,UDP), BLE, zigbee and etc) they wish to use.

## How to build

### Configurations
`CONFIG_EXAMPLE_MATTER` and `CONFIG_EXAMPLE_MATTER_BRIDGE` are automatically enabled in the Makefiles.

### Setup the Build Environment
  
    cd connectedhomeip
    source scripts/activate.sh
